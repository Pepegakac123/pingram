# Pingram - full-stack social media application

Pingram is a full-stack social media application designed as a simple adaptation of both Pinterest and Instagram. It allows users to create, edit, save, and mark posts as favorites, and features user authentication for secure access.

The application was developed using a range of modern technologies, including React, TypeScript, TanStack Router for efficient navigation management, and React Query for optimizing network requests. The frontend is fully responsive, utilizing TailwindCSS and Shadcn components to create a modern and intuitive user interface.

One of the key challenges I faced during development was implementing user authentication, as it was my first experience working with Appwrite for backend integration. This required me to frequently consult the documentation to find effective solutions.
